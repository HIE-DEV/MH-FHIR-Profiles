# MH-FHIR-Profiles
This provides the basic files and instructions necessary to install and setup a FHIR validator for Mental Health eDischarge using the Clarotech FHIRCheck Validator.

In the top-right, click 'download' and save the .ZIP to your machine. It's highly recommended to read the instructions first *before* extracting anything, as the folders will go in the FHIRCheck installation directory once setup.

This GitHub repo cannot provide a copy of the Clarotech FHIRCheck validator as it's a third party software program, which is free to download from:
http://clarotech.co.uk/products/tool-fhir-check/

Once you've downloaded this GitHub repo's .ZIP, open the ZIP, and read 'ClarotechInstructions.odt' (which is compatible with LibreOffice, OpenOffice and newer version of Microsoft Word).
