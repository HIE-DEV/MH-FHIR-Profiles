This provides the basic files and instructions necessary to install and setup a FHIR validator for Mental Health eDischarge using the Clarotech FHIRCheck Validator.

In the top-right, click 'download' and save the .ZIP to your machine. It's highly recommended to read the instructions contained within the .ZIP (called 'ClarotechInstructions.odt') first *before* extracting anything out of the .ZIP, as the folders will go in the FHIRCheck installation directory once installed (the .odt will explain how to set it up).

This GitHub repo cannot provide a copy of the Clarotech FHIRCheck validator as it's a third party software program, which is free to download from:
http://clarotech.co.uk/products/tool-fhir-check/

The Clarotech validator is a .exe, and so is only designed to work for Windows, however, given it appears to be a lightweight application, Linux users may be able to get it running with WINE.
